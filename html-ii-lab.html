	<p> <strong>Why do we love sloths?</strong></p>
<ol>
	<li> Because they are adorable and cuddly</li>
	<li> Little baby sloths are irresistable</li>
	<li> Seriously have you seen a sloth?</li>
	<li> No like really go adopt one right now</li>
</ol>
<p> Sloths are just really cool animals and super cuddly so you should probably adopt two to three of these immediately. They come in two different varieties, the two-toed sloth and the three-toed sloth. BOth are native to South America only but are common in zoo's and as domestic pets.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/sloths" target="_blank">"Sloths are the saviors of the internet."</a> They appear everywhere from annoying BuzzFeed articles, to tumblr pages, to the front page of reddit on r/aww which is one of the better websites on the internet. So if you ever need a dose of cuddly to pick up your day just google the magical baby sloth picture.</p>

<p>I'm probably going to adopt like 200 of these bad boys when I have the money and start an awesome home zoo of adorableness</p>
